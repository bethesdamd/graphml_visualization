## Graph visualization with Python NetworkX Library
Demonstrates several things related to graph processing:

- Python NetworkX to do the graph processing
- GraphML to store the graph
- matplotlib to render the graph
- iPython Notebooks to show the work

The dataset is small but shows an intuitive set of associations between actors and films.  Note that NetworkX has a rich set of features but we're only showing a few here.  Explore the NetworkX API for more insights.  This code is just meant to get the reader started with a few basics.

[Clicking on the ipynb file](https://github.com/bethesdamd/graphml_visualization/blob/master/Visualize%20GraphML.ipynb) shows not only the code but also the chart renderings.
